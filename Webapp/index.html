<!--
1. Hover boxes on graph are off by one day
2. After initial scraping change mode to "Update" which will only scrape most recent data. This will greatly
   decrease the time spent on database operations, which currently take up most of the runtime of our node jobs.
3. Rework highstock plotting utility. It's really redundant right now and would benefit from a more standardized data
   input interface with flags to differentiate types of plots.
4. Create a global routing framework for events that cause updates to data models. Right now all of these actions are
   scattered throughout the applicaiton and it is difficult to keep track of a lot of things
5. Create an API module which we can pass options and flags and callbacks in order to standardize our data queries.
6. More flexible interface for configuring subreddit charts (single chart mode or compare all mode to start)
7. Rework nodejs database operations
8. Change "drag and drop" alert to exist in a higher level of the view so it is not tied to a single detail page
9. General routing module should be able to do more. Think on this some more.
10. NodeApp: asyncUrlRequestProcessor sorting of returned data array not working?
